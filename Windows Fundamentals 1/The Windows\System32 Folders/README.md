# TASK 6: *The Windows\System32 Folders*

## 📌 Overview
The **Windows folder** (commonly `C:\Windows`) is the core directory that contains the Windows operating system files.  
- While traditionally located in the **C drive**, it can technically exist on any drive or even in a differently named folder.  
- Windows uses **environment variables** to dynamically reference such paths instead of hardcoding them.

## 🔹 Environment Variables
- **Definition**: Environment variables are **key–value pairs** that store information about the system and environment.  
- **Purpose**: They help applications and users interact with the OS without depending on fixed paths.  
- Example:  
  - `%windir%` → System environment variable that points to the Windows installation directory.  
  - `%temp%` → Directory used to store temporary files.  
  - `%path%` → List of directories where executable programs can be found.  

👉 This ensures Windows can locate important folders even if the OS is installed in a non-default directory.

## 🔹 System32 Folder
- Located inside the `Windows` folder (`C:\Windows\System32`).  
- Contains **critical system files**, drivers, and utilities required for Windows to function.  
- Examples of tools inside System32:  
  - `cmd.exe` → Command Prompt  
  - `taskmgr.exe` → Task Manager  
  - `notepad.exe` → Notepad  

⚠️ **Caution**: Deleting or modifying files in System32 can break the OS and make it unbootable.

## 🔹 Microsoft Definition

> *"Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. This includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used, and the location of temporary folders."*
