# TASK: *Windows User Accounts*

## 📌 Overview
On a typical local Windows system, user accounts fall into **two categories**:  
- **Administrator** → Full control over the system (add/remove users, modify groups, install software, change system settings).  
- **Standard User** → Restricted control, can only manage their own files and cannot make system-wide changes.  

👉 The **account type** determines the actions a user can perform on the system.
